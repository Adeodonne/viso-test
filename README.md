1.Had bug with alias, thats why used relative imports

2.Use Feature-sliced design as project structure(https://feature-sliced.design/docs/get-started/overview)

3.Also for styles used tailwind, to make them faster

4.There are not endpoint to get count of all recipes, I want just send requests like "www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?f={letter}" and get all recipes, but cors didnt allow me to do this
